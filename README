Code Sample Overview
Java:
  The Java files are used to read lines from an input file and output if the lines are pangrams or not. In this form it only does so
  with lowercase letters, though this could be modified to handle uppercase lines or mixed lines
  
C++:
  The C++ files detail a simulation for a Drone Collision Avoidance System, in which ten drones (named 'A' through 'J') are assigned two
  package delivery locations on a 40*40 grid (delivery locations are the lowercase version of the drone name). They each take off from
  a airport and make a delivery, return and then make their second delivery. The DCAS simulation prevents the drones from crashing into 
  each other and also tracks their deliveries.
  
C#:
  The C# files are a selection of code that I wrote for my software engineering project. They handle player interaction with game objects
  through Unity. The full project can be found at https://github.com/Mostly-BS-Totally-BA/mostly-bs-totally-ba
